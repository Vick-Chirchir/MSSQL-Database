Objective: Developing TQP queries 
Answer the following queries in SQL, RA, and QBE by using OES2 database. For SQL and RA, if the query requires join then develop solution for TIMES, Equi-Join, and Natural Join 

Note: Symbols to be used in RA: σ ⋈ π

Query 1: List unique pair of customer_no that both customers are from the same city.

π C.CUSTOMER_NO, C1.CUSTOMER_NO (σ C.CUSTOMER_NO > C1.CUSTOMER_NO    C.CITY = C1.CITY (C1) X (C))

--Relational Algebra (Join)

π C.CUSTOMER_NO, C1.CUSTOMER_NO (σ C.CUSTOMER_NO > C1.CUSTOMER_NO  (C1) ⋈  C1.CITY = CITY (C))

--Structure Query Language (Time)

SELECT C.CUSTOMER_NO, C1.CUSTOMER_NO FROM CUSTOMER C,CUSTOMER C1
WHERE C.CITY = C1.CITY AND C.CUSTOMER_NO > C1.CUSTOMER_NO;

--Structure Query Language (Join)

SELECT C.CUSTOMER_NO, C1.CUSTOMER_NO FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN CUSTOMER C1 ON C.CITY = C1.CITY
WHERE C.CUSTOMER_NO > C1.CUSTOMER_NO;

--Structure Query Language (Natural Join)

SELECT C.CUSTOMER_NO, C1.CUSTOMER_NO FROM CUSTOMER C
NATURAL JOIN CUSTOMER C1 USING (CITY)
WHERE C.CUSTOMER_NO > C1.CUSTOMER_NO;

--QBE
