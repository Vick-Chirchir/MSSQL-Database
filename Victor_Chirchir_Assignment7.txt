Objective: Developing queries using Object Relational Databases (OOES)
Answer the following queries by using OOES database. 

Query 1: List employee number, last name, city, state, number of orders, and their total sales. 

select e.employee_no NUM, e.employee.lname LNAME, a.city CITY, a.state STATE, sum(ol.qty) NUM_OF_ORDERS, sum(o.subtotal) TOTAL_SALES
from o_employee e, TABLE(ADDRESS) a, orderline ol, orders o
where e.employee_no = o.employee_no and o.order_no = ol.order_no
group by e.employee_no, e.employee.lname, a.city, a.state;


--SOLUTION
